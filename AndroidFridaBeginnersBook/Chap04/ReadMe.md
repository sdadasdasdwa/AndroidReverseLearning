# Objection real combat

There is a malware when start it will make huge noises and disconnect adb.

## Decompliation tools

List some static code decompilation tools that you maybe use.

+ Jadx
+ Jeb
+ GDA

## Operation Begining

1. Cannot connect USB?
    Termux. A software which can perform terminal on Android device.

    To solve how to start frida-server without adb on PC device.

    Otherwise, Objection support to use Network Connection, it can listen to Android port.

    You can use 'netstat' command to view the port which frida-server use.

    ```shell
    netstat -tulp | grep frida
    ```

    After seeing it, use Objection command.

    ```frida
    objection -N -h xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -p 8888 -g com.example.packagename explore
    
    -N : Network Listen Model
    ```

2. Traverse services

    ```frida
    android hooking list services
    ```

    The above code will iterate over services.

    But we cannot see which function cause the phenomena. So we should hook the whole service class.
3. Hook MyServiceOne Class

    ```frida
    android hooking watch class com.example.MyServiceOne
    ```

    Then you can find that MyServiceOne.access$L1000018 Method is called.

    Use Jeb to find the corresponding function.

    ```java
    public void run(){
        ...
        Object v1 = MyServiceOne.this.getSystemService("audio");
        // set the max volume
        v1.setStreamVolume(3,v1,getStreamMaxVolunme(3),4);
        v1.getStreamMaxVolume(0);
        v1.getStreamMaxVolume(0);
        MyServiceOne.this.getApplication()
                    .getSystemService("vibrator")
                    .vibrate(new long[]{((long)100),((long)1500),((long)100),((long)1500),-1})
        ...
    }
    ```

    Then you know what make the voice noise. And then we touch the unlock logic.

4. UnLock Buttonï¼Ÿ

    when you click unlock button, you will find some functions are called.
    Following the principle that the function printed first is called first, we will hook a method instead of the whole class methods.

    ```frida
    android hooking watch class_method com.example.MyServiceOne.xxxmethod --dump-args --dump-backtrace --dump-return
    dump-args : print arguments
    dump-backtrace : print heap trace
    dump-return : print function return value
    ```

    TIPS: the backtrace content perform that functions printed first is called last.

    Finally, you can find the OnClick function operation make the REPL effect.

## frida development philosophy

1. Objection Assisted localization

    ```frida
    // install and traverse all activity later start corresponding activity
    android intent launch activity com.example.CaculatorActivity

    // verify if the function exists
    android hooking list class_methods com.example.CalculatorActivity

    // hook the method
    android hooking watch class method com.example.CalculatorActivity.caculate --dump-args --dump-backtrace --dump-return
    ```
