# App security offence and defense process

This section introduces the upgrade pop-up prompt of an unprotected app.

## Practical analysis and cracking of an unprotected app

In Android, there are three main comman ways to implement pop-ups:

1. android.App.Dialog
2. android.App.AlertDialog
3. android.widget.PopupWindow

To find the upgrade dialog, decompile source code and search for relevent characters, like this:

![test picture](../Sceenshots/image1.png)

use frida to inject:

```shell
android heap searrch instances android.App.AlertDialog
android heap searrch instances android.App.Dialog
android heap searrch instances android.wdiget.PopupWindow
```

Recommand an Objection plugin - Wallbreaker, which enhances Objection's
memory search functionality  with practical examples.

```shell
objection -g com.hd.zhibo explore -P /plugins/

plugin wallbreaker objectionsearch android.app.AlertDialog
# print: [0x2582] xxx

plugin wallbreaker objectdump 0x2582
# The text content displayed in the upgrade prompt pop-up.
```

But sorry, the com.hd.zhibo App has already outdate and is no longer maintained.So I can't screencap any picture.

Since the Hook has no effect if triggered after the function call, and the sample app's
upgrade prompt pops up as soon as the app enters the main page, it's necessary to ensure
that the sample is hooked as soon as the startup function is invokedï¼Œso

```shell
objection -g com.hd.zhibo explore -s "android hooking watch class android.App.AlertDialog"
```

Then you will find that some functions is invoked, like

```shell
[xxx] Called android.App.AlertDialog.resolveDialogTheme
[xxx] Called android.App.AlertDialog.resolveDialogTheme
[xxx] Called android.App.AlertDialog.onCreate
```

After testing, choose onCreate function to hook and print stack trace.

```shell
android hooking watch class_method adnroid.App.AlertDialog.onCreate --dump-args --dump-backtrace --dump-return
```

That you can find update_show function:

## practical cracking of unprotected app

1. use apktool to decompile the app

After decompiling, Locate the Smali file corresponding to the 'channel_main' class:

![image3.png](../Sceenshots/image3.png)

2. modify the Smali code

Based on the logic, we choose to modify 'if-eqz, :cond_0' by changing 'if-eqz' to 'if-nez'

Then use the following command to repackage the app.

```shell
apktool b zhibo
```

3. Sign the App

We need to use 'jarsigner' or other Android-approved signing tools to re-sign the App.

```shell
keytool -genkeypair -alias abc -keyalg RSA -keystore E:\Project\ASCD\AndroidFridaBeginnersBook\Chap05\zhibo\dist\abc.keystore
```

![image4.png](../Sceenshots/image4.png)

```shell
jarsigner -verbose -keystore E:\Project\ASCD\AndroidFridaBeginnersBook\Chap05\zhibo\dist\abc.keystore -signedjar zhibo_patch.apk zhibo.apk abc
```

4. Finally reinstall the app

## Practical analysis and cracking of an protected app

'app' : com.hello.qqc.apk

In this instance app, you find that you can't dismiss the popup by clicking outside the window.

### Search Related Class

Firstly, search for instances of relevant classes.

```shell
plugin wallbreaker objectsearch android.app.AlertDialog
plugin wallbreaker objectsearch android.app.Dialog
plugin wallbreaker objectsearch android.widget.PopupWindow
```

### Hook

To identify the class responsible for implementing a popup by hooking each suspected popup class,
you could follow these steps:

1. Use 'watch class' way to hook related class before enter the HomePage.

```shell
android hooking watch class android.App.AlertDialog
```

[Picture Here]

The above code is not userful, no any function is invoked during the process.

```shell
android hooking watch class android.App.Dialog
```

[Picture Here]

Then, you will find many functions are called, such as 'setCancelable(boolean)' function.

2. Hook setCalcelable function

```shell
android hooking watch class_method android.App.Dialog.setCancelable --dump-args --dump-backtrace --dump-return
```

[Picture Here]

You can see what call the andoird.App.Dialog is 'cn.net.tokyo.ccg.ui.fragment.dialog.UpdateDIalogFragment.onCreateDialog()' function.

3. Unpack the app

Something was different with the unprotected app.

If you use Jadx to uncompile the protected app, only some class information from the external shell is visible.

The only option is to unpack it, 'Dexdump' is another masterpiece by the author of Wallbreaker.

The basic principle of its unpacking is to perform a brute-force search for data in memory that match the 
DEX format to complete the dumping process.


```shell
git clone https://github.com/hluwa/FRIDA-DEXDump
```

we do not load plugin by adding the -P parameters and plugin path during injection,
instead we load plugin by using plugin command in Objection REPL interface after the Objection injection.

```shell
plugin load /plugins/dexdump
```
